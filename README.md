I am a computational scientist and software engineer, with experience developing multi-physics simulation algorithms for advanced heterogeneous computing architectures. I have expertise in numerical methods used in computational fluid dynamics, astrophysics, and plasma physics, and designing systems for scientific computing.

I also have a blog about simulation methods, accessible at the undergraduate level, using Python, which you can find here: [https://philip-mocz.medium.com](https://philip-mocz.medium.com)
